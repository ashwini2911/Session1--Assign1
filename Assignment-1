Explain the following terms in detail:
1. Various sources of Big Data
2. 3 V's of Big Data
3. Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling
4. Need and Working of Hadoop


1. Various sources of data
a. Stock Exchange
b. Facebook
c. Internet Archive
d. Twitter
e. Bank
f. Shopping Complex
g. Various online sources

2. 3 V's of BigData
a. Volume-data size
b. Velocity-speed of change
c. Variety-data sources

3. Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling
a. Horizontal Scaling- It is scaling up the system to increase the configuration of a single system like RAM,Disk space to process he BigData. But it is complx and time consuming.
b. Vertical Scaling- It means to scale the system out to use multiple machines and their configuration to distribute the load and to process the bigdata.

4. Need and Working of Hadoop
Scaling out is the solution to process bigdata but this solution comes with some challenges like-
a. It should be able to handle structured and unstructured data.
b. to process huge dataset on large clusters of machine.
c. To manage nodes failure.
d. During analysis take result from different machines and assesmble it at one place.
This all challenges lead to development of a new system which takes care of these challenges called HADOOP.
Working of Hadoop-
Hadoop framework is incorporated with two things-
a. HDFS
b. MAap Reduce
a. HDFS- hdfs is Hadoop Distributed File System used to store and manage the large volume of data in Hadoop.
b. Map Reduce- Map Reduce is a combination of two functions-
      Map- Map is a functional code which rotates on multiple connected nodes and executes/processes the data stored in their disk.
      Reduce- Reduce function collects the result and assesmble it to the server node.
